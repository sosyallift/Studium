# Studium
Studium is an app that I am personally developing to help bring order and organization to students lives. The app is targetted at college students, but is definitely useful for grade school, or other students.

Why is Studium so great?
- Studium has an incredibly user friendly and satisfying design/user interface. Adding information like courses and assignments, for the app to track takes just a couple of seconds
- It comes with a "Habits" feature. Students are very busy, and sometimes managing life outside of schoolwork can be tough. Do not fear! Studium is here! The Habits feature allows students to plan extracurricular activities like going to the gym, club meetings, and even meals. The habits also contains an "autoschedule" feature, which tasks the app with scheduling habits for you.
- All of the information that you need comes with the click of a button. Easily view the schedule for the day you have ahead of you with the Day Viewer. You can also scroll to see what is planned for days to come.
- Easily view a plan of your entire month with the Calendar Viewer. 
- All of the information that you create is color coded and super easy to understand

Studium is currently available on TestFlight for beta testing. Please contact me at vdsingh@umass.edu if interested in testing!
