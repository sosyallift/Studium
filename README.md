# Studium
As a college student, managing time can be a difficult and tedious (and it can be a time intensive task in itself!). Studium is an iOS app that I am developing to help combat this issue by bring order and organization to students' lives. Studium will show you your schedule for every day, with your courses, assignments, and habits already all planned out. You can also view the entire month ahead of you with the month viewer. Studium will send you notifications before each course, assignment, and habit, so you're never late for anything (the times at which you receive notifications are customizable as well). You also have the option to add a logo and color code courses, assignments and habits. Studium comes with an autoschedule feature for habits: it will analyze your daily schedule and schedule habits at a time that works best for you - so that you don't have to manually plan time for the gym (and other habits) around your courses. All of your assignments, habits, and courses are listed in different views that are easy to navigate, so you have access to any and all important information instantly.

# Studium in a Nutshell!
- Studium has an incredibly user friendly and satisfying design/user interface. Adding information like courses and assignments, for the app to track takes just a couple of seconds
- It comes with a "Habits" feature. Students are very busy, and sometimes managing life outside of schoolwork can be tough. Do not fear! The Habits feature allows students to plan extracurricular activities like going to the gym, club meetings, and even meals. The habits also contains an "autoschedule" feature, which tasks the app with scheduling your habits around courses and assignments that are already in your day.
- All of the information that you need comes with the click of a button. Easily view the schedule for the day you have ahead of you with the Day Viewer. You can also scroll to see what is planned for days to come.
- Easily view a plan of your entire month with the Calendar Viewer. 
- All of the information is logo and color coded and super easy to understand

Studium is currently available on TestFlight for beta testing. Please contact me at vdsingh@umass.edu if interested in testing!
