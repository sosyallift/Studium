# Studium
As a college student, managing time can be a difficult and tedious (and it can be a time intensive task in itself!). Studium is an iOS app that I am developing to help combat this issue by bring order and organization to students' lives. 

## Studium in a Nutshell
- Studium has an incredibly user friendly and satisfying design/user interface. Adding information like courses and assignments, for the app to track takes just a couple of seconds
- Studium will show you your schedule for every day, with your courses, assignments, and habits already all planned out.
- Easily view a plan of your entire month with the Calendar Viewer. 
- Studium will send you notifications before each course, assignment, and habit, so you're never late for anything (the times at which you receive notifications are customizable as well).
- Studium comes with an autoschedule feature for habits: it will analyze your daily schedule and schedule habits at a time that works best for you - so that you don't have to manually plan time for the gym (and other habits) around your courses. 
- All of your assignments, habits, and courses are listed in different views that are easy to navigate, so you have access to any and all important information instantly.
- All of the information is logo and color coded, making it easy and quick to interpret.

Studium is currently available on TestFlight for beta testing. Please contact me at vdsingh@umass.edu if interested in testing!
